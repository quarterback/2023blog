Ron Bronson has been building things online for two decades. His career has been focused on helping bureaucracies navigate large-scale transformation; and navigating digital products from ideation to post-launch. Ron speaks at events around the world on various topics on experience design. Right now, he's head of design at [18F](http://18f.gsa.gov/).

He's served on boards, launched conferences, and was even a news anchor at a [community radio station](https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/daily-local-news-wfhb-492801) for a little while. Years ago, he served in the U.S Air Force. More randomly, he [invented an actual sport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_polo) at summer camp.

Currently based in Portland, he volunteers with Code for PDX, [Out of Office Hours](http://outofofficehours.com) & runs the local skeeball league. Offline, Ron is a high school tennis coach, amateur tea sommelier, would gleefully introduce you to [(Pesäpallo)](https://www.superpesis.fi/uutiset/yhdysvaltalainen-ron-bronson-toteutti-unelmansa-ja-matkusti-suomeen-katsomaan-pesapalloa/).
