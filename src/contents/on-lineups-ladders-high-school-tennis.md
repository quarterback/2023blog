When I tell people I coach high school tennis, they're somewhat curious about the format. Given that tennis isn't really a team sport, it seems like an odd fit for school team sports and for the most part, it is. The beauty of high school tennis, in contrast to competitive junior circuits, is that kids in that 13/14-18 age group can be mostly of average ability levels and get a lot more experience than they'd otherwise get playing on their own.

The team aspect also has a lot of benefit for kids who might otherwise struggle in other sports, and with even remotely okay coaching, multi-sport athletes can pick up tennis as a side sport during their off-seasons to stay in shape. Not every sport lends itself to this kind of dexterity. For schools, it's a pretty cheap sport to offer as they only need to pay for travel, a coach and tennis balls. Kids provide their own racquets and courts can be found in most communities.

**Structure**

The structure of the sport is a little strange, but in most states, you essentially have singles & doubles "positions" much like a 1st or 2nd chair in orchestra. Except in tennis, the purpose is essentially to match evenly skilled kids against each other in these singles/doubles roles. In college, you're able to play both singles & doubles. Some high school states (like Texas and Kansas, I think..) allow this too, but most states do not allow kids to double up, which makes sense, as the goal for a high school program is increasing sport access to the most kids.

Another one of the oddities of high school tennis is unlike basketball, you don't really need to play high school tennis if you're a high-achieving player. Being a global sport, tennis has a robust layer of circuits at every level including "Grand Slams" for junior players that happen year-round. In this era, no kid remotely good enough for elite junior tennis would consider playing high school tennis, but this trickles down even to kids who are Division 1 quality, with the resources for full-time coaching. Kids and parents who choose high school tennis are largely making an active choice, to give their kids a chance to be socialized with their peers and an opportunity to represent their school. Given how few kids will go on to play college tennis, it's a truly unique opportunity and turns an individual sport into something that's a lot more fun.

**On ladders and variation**

The basic structure of a high school tennis lineup has been the same pretty much forever. Tennis coaches setup a "ladder" at the beginning of the season that essentially ranks everyone on the team from top to bottom. In order to move up a spot, you _challenge_ the person in front of you. In theory, this model is quite fair because it means that anyone playing varsity on a tennis team has pretty much earned their job. There's not a lot of subjectivity like a basketball or football coach deals with, no "playing time" issues in the same way.

I've always been wary of ladders, partially because of my own high school experience where I often felt (at times) the ladder too rigid for the realities of the situation. A player could be a very good doubles partner that works extremely well in a unit, but not as good a singles player. Most ladders are singles ladders, meaning you challenge someone for a doubles spot, but play singles for it.

When I started running camp programs in my early 20s, I immediately flipped this model and created a relatively elaborate three-tier system that started kids off playing mini-tennis (from service line to service line) in a competitive event, through a top-tier for the highest performers. For me, giving kids the confidence to move up meant that they were more inclined to want to participate, and creating space for kids to casually enjoy the game meant that the stakes were a lot less high. Tennis is easy to pick up, but extremely hard to master and it's why so many people give it up. If I had a dollar for every person who told me they "played tennis in gym class" or "tried it when they were young and gave up," I'd be able to eat pretty well, because it's a common refrain.

Over the years, I refined this model. As a high school coach, I couldn't do this because there was a lot less time. So instead, I tweaked my ladder model for the compressed high school season. After an initial position "playoff" of sorts early in the season, kids are allowed to challenge up within 2 spots from their position. I also offer a one-time "wild card" that lower-ranked players can use to shoot up the ladder faster. This is handy when a kid shows up mid-season, is injured or has a lot of progress in a short period of time. Wild cards can only be used at the coach's discretion, so it means you don't have to accept a wild card challenge if you don't want to.

**Getting players to buy-in**

Ladders do not help players buy-in. They mostly take an individual sport and turn it into a cutthroat exercise where players near each other are more interested in ensuring their own position at the expense of the team's goals. Head-to-head matches are necessary for coaches to get a sense of how players perform, and to give players peace of mind that they really earned their spot.

This does not apply to having the 8th or 13th best player get beat by the top player unless it's a really deep team. Bigger teams in larger tennis-playing areas will schedule week-long tournaments where players will duel in essentially a pod-format series of matches to determine the lineup over time. I prefer this, but this format _only_ works in a place where parents, the school & kids are aligned around this type of match-format, mostly because you need to leverage non-school courts and non-school time to carry out the sheer number of matches this would require. 

In the absence of a full-on tournament, I believe that anyone who earned a varsity letter the year before ought to be given the opportunity to play for their spot. Newbies are ultimately playing for the varsity spots left open from graduation/injuries/players who chose not to return, and then we sort out the lineup from there.

Is this the fairest way to manage things? Probably not. There could be a glut of freshman/transfers who show up and able to duel their way onto the lineup from the start of the season. This might be true, and ultimately, they'll earn their way into the lineup if they're remotely patient. But if our goal is to build a team culture, part of that comes from having players who have been around providing continuity to carry that forward. 

On my best teams, veterans are almost always willing to defer to younger players to give them more experience against inferior competition, which is a win-win as the adjustment from playing junior tennis to the weirdness of high school tennis can be sometimes be difficult even for the most battle-hardened talents, because the conditions are unusual.
